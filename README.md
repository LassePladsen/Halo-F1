# Halo F1

**A Formula 1 desktop companion for the JC4827W543 (ESP32-S3 + 4.3" TFT)**

Halo F1 is a small, always-on display that shows everything you need about the current F1 season — next race session times in your local timezone, the full drivers' and constructors' championship standings, the latest session results, and F1 news headlines. No apps, no browser tabs, no ads. Just a glance at your desk.

The pre-compiled firmware is free to install from the [project website](https://halof1.com/). This repository contains the full source code for reference and personal use.

## Features

- **Session Times** — FP1, FP2, FP3, Sprint Qualifying, Sprint Race, Qualifying and Race start times for the upcoming weekend, automatically converted to your local timezone
- **Drivers' Championship** — Full standings table updated throughout the season; includes a pre-season fallback that populates the driver and constructor roster before the first race
- **Session Results** — Qualifying (Q1/Q2/Q3) and race results fetched from the live OpenF1 API, including gap to leader
- **Latest News** — F1 headlines pulled from an RSS feed (currently English only)
- **Night Mode** — Configurable dimming window; set start/stop times and a separate night brightness level
- **6 Languages** — English, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch, German
- **Captive-portal Wi-Fi setup** — On first boot the device broadcasts an access point (`Halo-F1`); connect from any phone or laptop to enter your home network credentials. No app or computer required after initial flashing
- **Update notifications** — The device checks for new firmware versions on startup and shows an in-app notification if an update is available

## Flashing

The easiest way to install the firmware is via the project website, directly from Chrome or Edge — no software needed:

**[halof1.com](https://halof1.com/)**

If you want to compile from source, see the [Building from Source](#building-from-source) section below.

---

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 2.x
- ESP32 Arduino core (`esp32` by Espressif, tested on **3.x**)

### Arduino Libraries

Install the following through the Library Manager (Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries):

| Library       | Author          |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| `LVGL`        | LVGL            |
| `WiFiManager` | tzapu           |
| `ArduinoJson` | Benoit Blanchon |
| `bb_spi_lcd`  | Larry Bank      |

> **Note:** `lv_conf.h` must be configured for the JC4827W543 display before compiling. The `lv_conf.h` included in this repository is already set up correctly.

### Pin Configuration

The following defines are set at the top of `F1Halo.ino` and match the JC4827W543 board:

```cpp
#define DISPLAY_TYPE    DISPLAY_CYD_543
#define TOUCH_CAPACITIVE
#define TOUCH_SDA        8
#define TOUCH_SCL        4
#define TOUCH_INT        3
#define TOUCH_RST       -1
#define TOUCH_MOSI      11
#define TOUCH_MISO      13
#define TOUCH_CLK       12
#define TOUCH_CS        38
#define SCREEN_WIDTH   272
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT  480
```

### Compiling and Uploading

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `F1Halo.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select **ESP32S3 Dev Module** as the target board
4. Set **Flash Size** to **4MB**, **PSRAM** to **OPI PSRAM** (8 MB), and **Partition Scheme** to `Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)`. Set **USB CDC On Boot** to **enabled** to get Serial feed via USB
5. Connect the board via a USB-A to USB-C data cable
6. If the port does not appear, hold `BOOT`, press `RST`, then release `BOOT` to enter flash mode
7. Click **Upload**

## Data Sources

Halo F1 fetches all data over HTTPS. No account or API key is required.

| Driver standings              | [Jolpica / Ergast F1 API](https://jolpi.ca/) |
| Race calendar & session times | [Jolpica / Ergast F1 API](https://jolpi.ca/) |
| Live session results          | [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org/)            |
| News headlines                | The Race — RSS feed                          |

### Anonymous Statistics

On startup, and periodically, the device sends a minimal anonymous ping to a server at `we-race.it`. This request carries:

- A randomly generated device UUID (generated once, stored in flash)
- The selected display language
- The configured UTC offset
- The current firmware version

No personal data, Wi-Fi credentials, location or network information is ever transmitted. This telemetry is used solely to count active installs, check for firmware updates and deliver in-app notifications such as release announcements. You can verify this behaviour yourself in the `sendStatisticData()` function inside `wifi_handler.h`.
